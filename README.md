TODO LIST:

- [ ] write new readme

# Contributing

If you would like to contribute, please open a pull request. Currently I am trying to rewrite the entire patcher as it's own application that uses UndertaleModLib as a library, rather than being a script run through UndertaleModTool.

# Compilation

To compile the application yourself, you need to have `.NET Core 8 SDK` or later be installed.
Then, go to `src/` directory and execute `dotnet publish` command. You can also provide additional arguments for compilation, see the [Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish).
