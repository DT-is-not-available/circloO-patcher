- `build.js` is the nodejs file that combines all the source files in `src/` together
- `project.json` is the file im reading so i dont have a long command for configuring my build options (literally just `node build` and it does the thing)
- `src/` is the source folder
- `bin/` is the output folder if you want to build it yourself
